Application Breakdown:
1. User Authentication:
The login is simple and front-end based for now, without password storage or protection (this would require backend logic for secure handling).
A user enters their username and proceeds to the task dashboard.
2. Task Management:
Users can input the task name, deadline, and category.
After adding the task, it appears in a task list with the task name, deadline, and category.
Tasks can be deleted.
3. Task Organization:
Tasks are organized by categories chosen from the dropdown.
You can extend this by adding category filters on the dashboard view.
4. Dashboard:
The dashboard displays the tasks that the user has added.
It also allows users to log out, bringing them back to the login screen.
